# Helmet-Detection-System
A Helmet Detection System is an automated solution that uses computer vision and machine learning to check if individuals are wearing helmets in real-time video feeds or images. The system works by processing video streams from surveillance cameras to detect human figures, isolating the head region, and identifying the presence of a helmet.
